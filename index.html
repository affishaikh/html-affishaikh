        <h1><center>Naruto's secret</center></h1>
        <p><center>12 years ago, a vicious tailed beast known as the Nine-Tails, attacked the shinobi village of Konohagakure. Many shinobi fought the beast, but it defeated and killed all those that stood in front of it. Luckily, the town was saved when the villages leader, the Fourth Hokage, sealed the beast with an infant boy at the cost of his own life. In the present, Naruto Uzumaki is a prankster who is constantly causing trouble throughout Konohagakure, most recently having placed graffiti all over the Hokage Rock. Much of the village dislikes him for it, but he enjoys the attention garnered from reprimands, as he had no parents or friends due to the villagers abusing him daily for no apparent reason. Despite claiming to be a talented shinobi who would someday become Hokage, Naruto is incapable of performing basic techniques such as the Clone Technique. When this leaves him unable to graduate from the Academy, one of his instructors, Mizuki, tells Naruto that if he could steal the Scroll of Seals and learn one of its secret techniques he would be allowed to continue on to the ranks of the ninja anyway and graduate. After successfully stealing the scroll, Naruto is caught by another instructor, Iruka Umino, who realised that Naruto had been tricked. Iruka protects Naruto from the Mizuki who is planning to take the scroll for himself. Mizuki tells Naruto that he has the Nine-Tails sealed within him on the day of his birth. He goes on to explain that the villagers hate him for the monster he contains and that Iruka, whose parents were killed by the Nine-Tails, must hate him the most. Iruka said this was not the case, as he did not blame Naruto for the beasts actions, and that in fact he, having grown up also craving attention, sympathised with Naruto. Naruto believes Iruka and uses his newly-mastered Multiple Shadow Clone Technique to defeat Mizuki. Amazed by the complicated technique that Naruto has learned, Iruka officially makes Naruto a ninja by giving him his own forehead protector, and notes that he may one day have the potential to become Hokage.</center></p></section>
